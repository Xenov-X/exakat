description = "The included files doesn't exists in the repository. The inclusions target a files that doesn't exist.

The analysis works with every type of inclusion : include, require, include_once and require_once. It also works with parenthesis when used as parameter delimiter.

The analysis doesn't take into account include_path. This may yield false positives.

<?php

include 'non_existent.php';

// variables are not resolved. This won't be reported.
require ($path.'non_existent.php');

?>

Missing included files may lead to a fatal error, a warning or other error later in the execution.
