name = "Safe Curl Options";
description = "It is advised to always use ``CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER`` and ``CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST`` when requesting a SSL connection. 

With those tests, the certificate is verified, and if it isn't valid, the connection fails : this is a safe behavior.

<?php
$ch = curl_init();

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, https://www.php.net/);

// To be safe, always set this to true
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, true);

curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);
?>
