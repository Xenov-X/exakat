name = "Strings With Strange Space";
description = "An invisible space may be mistaken for a normal space. 

However, PHP does straight comparisons, and may fail at recognizing. This analysis reports when it finds such strange spaces inside strings.

PHP doesn't mistake space and tables for whitespace when tokenizing the code.

This analysis doesn't report Unicode Codepoint Notation : those are visible in the code.

<?php

// PHP 7 notation, 
$a = "\u{3000}";
$b = " ";

// Displays false
var_dump($a === $b);

?>
