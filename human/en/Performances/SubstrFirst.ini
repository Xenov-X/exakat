name = "Substring First";
description = "Always start by reducing a string before applying some transformation on it. The shorter string will be processed faster. 

<?php

// fast version
$result = strtolower(substr($string, $offset, $length));

// slower version
$result = substr(strtolower($string), $offset, $length);
?>

The gain produced here is greater with longer strings, or greater reductions. They may also be used in loops. This is a micro-optimisation when used on short strings and single string reductions.

This works with any reduction function instead of substr(), like trim(), iconv(), etc.
