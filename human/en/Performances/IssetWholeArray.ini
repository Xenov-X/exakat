description = "Isset() works quietly on a whole array. There is no need to test all previous index before testing for the target index.

<?php

// Straight to the point
if (isset($a[1]['source'])) {
    // Do something with $a[1]['source']
}

// Doing too much work
if (isset($a) && isset($a[1]) && isset($a[1]['source'])) {
    // Do something with $a[1]['source']
}

?>

There is a gain in readability, by avoiding long and hard to read logical expression, and reducing them in one simple isset call.

There is a gain in performances by using one call to isset, instead of several, but it is a micro-optimization.
