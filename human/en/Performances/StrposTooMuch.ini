name = "Strpos Too Much";
description = "Strpos covers the whole string before reporting 0. If the expected string is expected be at the beginning, or a fixed place, it is more stable to use substr() for comparison.

The longer the haystack (the searched string), the more efficient is that trick. The string has to be 10k or more to have impact. 

<?php

// This always reads the same amount of string
if (substr($html, 0, 6) === '<html>') {

}

// When searching for a single character, $string[$position] is even faster
if ($html[0] === '<') {

}

// This is the best way, however the needle is found
if (strpos($html, '<html>') > 0) {

}

// When the search fails, the whole string has been read
if (strpos($html, '<html>') === 0) {
