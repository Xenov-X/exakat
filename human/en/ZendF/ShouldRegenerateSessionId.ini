name = "Should Regenerate Session Id";
description = "No mention of Zend\Session::regenerateId() method found. 

When using Zend\Session, or PHP session, a session ID is assigned to the user. It is a random number, used to connect the user and its data on the server. Actually, anyone with the session ID may have access to the data. This is why those session ID are so long and complex.

A good approach to protect the session ID is to reduce its lifespan : the shorter the time of use, the better. While changing the session ID at every hit on the page may no be possible, a more reasonable approach is to change the session id when an important action is about to take place. What important means is left to the application to decide.

Based on this philopsophy, a code source that uses Zend\Session but never uses Zend\Session::regenerateId() has to be updated.

<?php

    //Getting the session manager from the application
   $session = $e->getApplication()
                ->getServiceManager()
                ->get('Zend\Session\SessionManager');

?>
