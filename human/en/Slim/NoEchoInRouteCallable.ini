name = "No Echo In Route Callable";
description = "Avoid using echo(), print() or any printable PHP within the route callable method. 

echo() works, it is prevents the code from setting any status code. This leads to confusion when the code return the content, but fail to set the right HTTP codes.

Slim 4.0 will require to only use the return method : the route callable is required to return a response. 

<?php
$app = new Slim\App();

// This works as expected, with or without status
$app->get('/', function ($request, $response, $args) {
    return new MyResponseInterface ('content');
});

// This works, but only on surface
$app->get('/', function ($request, $response, $args) {
    echo 'content';
});

?>
