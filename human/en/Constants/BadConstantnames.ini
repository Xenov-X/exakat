name = "Bad Constants Names";
description = "PHP's manual recommends that developper do not use constants with the convention ``__NAME__``. Those are reserved for PHP future use. 

For example, ``__TRAIT__`` recently appeared in PHP, as a magic constant. In the future, other may appear. 

<?php

const __MY_APP_CONST__ = 1;

define('__MY_OTHER_APP_CONST__', 2);

?>

The analyzer will report any constant which name is __.*.__, or even _.*_ (only one underscore).
