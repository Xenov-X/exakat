name = "Could Be Abstract Class";
description = "An abstract class is never instantiated, and has children class that are. As such, a 'parent' class that is never instantiated by itself, but has its own children instantiated could be marked as abstract. 

That will prevent new code to try to instantiate it.

<?php

// Example code would actually be split over multiple files.


// That class could be abstract
class motherClass {}

// Those classes shouldn't be abstract
class firstChildren extends motherClass {}
class secondChildren extends motherClass {}
class thirdChildren extends motherClass {}

new firstChildren();
new secondChildren();
new thirdChildren();

//Not a single : new motherClass()

?>
