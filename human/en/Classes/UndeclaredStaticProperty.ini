name = "Undeclared Static Property";
description = "Use the right syntax when reaching a property. Static properties use the ``::`` operator, and non-static properties use ``->``. 

Mistaking one of the other has two different reactions from PHP : ``Access to undeclared static property`` is a fatal error, while ``PHP Notice:  Accessing static property aa::$a as non static`` is a notice.

<?php

class a { 
    static public $a = 1;
    
    function foo() {
        echo self::$a; // right
        echo $this->a; // WRONG
    }
}

class b { 
    public $b = 1;

    function foo() {
        echo $this->$b;  // right
        echo b::$b;      // WRONG
    }
}

?>
