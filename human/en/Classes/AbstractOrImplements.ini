While PHP lints this code, it won't execute it and stop with a Fatal Error : `Class BA contains 1 abstract method and must therefore be declared abstract or implement the remaining methods (A::aFoo)`.

<?php

abstract class Foo { 
    abstract function FooBar();
}

// This is in another file : php -l would detect it right away

class FooFoo extends Foo { 
    // The method is not defined. 
    // The class must be abstract, just like Foo
}
