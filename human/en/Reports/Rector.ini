Some issues spotted by Exakat may be fixed automagically by Rector. Rector offers more than 550 (and counting) rules, that may save countless hours of work. 

For example, [CombinedAssignRector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector/blob/master/docs/AllRectorsOverview.md#combinedassignrector), simplifies ``$value = $value + 5`` into ``+$value += 5;``. On Exakat, the rule [Structures/CouldUseShortAssignation]((https://exakat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Rules.html#could-use-short-assignation) spot those too.

Not all exakat rules are covered by Rector, and vice-versa. [CompactToVariablesRector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector/blob/master/docs/AllRectorsOverview.md#compacttovariablesrector) aims Ã  skipping usage of compact(), while [Structures/CouldUseCompact](https://exakat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Rules.html#could-use-compact) suggest the contrary. 

Rector and Exakat both use different approaches to code review. It is recommended to review the changes before commiting them.
