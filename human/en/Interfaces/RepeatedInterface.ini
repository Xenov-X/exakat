name = "Repeated Interface";
description = "A class should implements only once an interface.

PHP accepts multiple times the same interface in the `implements` clause. In fact, it doesn't do anything beyond the first implement. 

<?php

use i as j;

interface i {}

// Multiple ways to reference an interface
class foo implements i, \i, j {}

// This applies to interfaces too
interface bar extends i, \i, j {}

?>
