description = "Captured subpatterns may be named, for easier reference. 

From the manual : It is possible to name a subpattern using the syntax `(?P<name>pattern)`. This subpattern will then be indexed in the matches array by its normal numeric position and also by name. PHP 5.2.2 introduced two alternative syntaxes `(?<name>pattern)` and `(?'name'pattern)`.

Naming subpatterns makes it easier to know what is read from the results of the subpattern : for example, `$r['name']` has more meaning than `$r[1]`. 

Named subpatterns may also be shifted in the regex without impact on the resulting array. 

<?php

$x = 'abc';
preg_match_all('/(?<name>a)/', $x, $r);
print_r($r[1]);
print_r($r['name']);

preg_match('/(?<name>a)(?<sub>b)/', $x, $s);
print $r[2];
print $r['sub'];

?>
