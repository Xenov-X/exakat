name = "Use Count Recursive";
description = "The code could use the recursive version of count.

The second argument of count, when set to ``COUNT_RECURSIVE``, count recursively the elements. It also counts the elements themselves. 

<?php

$array = array( array(1,2,3), array(4,5,6));

print (count($array, COUNT_RECURSIVE) - count($array, COUNT_NORMAL));

$count = 0;
foreach($array as $a) {
    $count += count($a);
}
print $count;

?>
