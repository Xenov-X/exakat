name = "Objects Don't Need References";
description = "There is no need to create references for objects, as those are always passed by reference when used as arguments.

Note that when the argument is assigned another value, including another object, then the reference is needed : PHP forgets about reference when they are replaced.

<?php
    
    $object = new stdClass();
    $object->name = 'a';
    
    foo($object);
    print $object->name; // Name is 'b'
    
    // No need to make $o a reference
    function foo(&$o) {
        $o->name = 'b';
    }

    
    // $o is assigned inside the function : it must be called with a &, or the object won't make it out of the foo3 scope
    function foo3(&$o) {
        $o = new stdClass;
    }
    
    $array = array($object);
    foreach($array as &$o) { // No need to make this a reference
        $o->name = 'c';
    }

?>
