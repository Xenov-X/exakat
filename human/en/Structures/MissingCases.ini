name = "Missing Cases In Switch";
description = "It seems that some cases are missing in this switch structure.

When comparing two different switch() structures, it appears that some cases are missing in one of them. The set of cases are almost identical, but one of the values are missing. 

Switch() structures using strings as literals are compared in this analysis. When the discrepancy between two lists is below 25%, both switches are reported.

<?php

// This switch operates on a, b, c, d and default 
switch($a) {
    case 'a': doSomethingA(); break 1;
    case 'b': doSomethingB(); break 1;
    case 'c': doSomethingC(); break 1;
    case 'd': doSomethingD(); break 1;
    default: doNothing();
}

// This switch operates on a, b, d and default 
switch($o->p) {
    case 'a': doSomethingA(); break 1;
    case 'b': doSomethingB(); break 1;

    case 'd': doSomethingD(); break 1;
    default: doNothing();
}

?>

In the example, one may argue that the 'c' case is actually handled by the 'default' case. Otherwise, business logic may request that omission.
