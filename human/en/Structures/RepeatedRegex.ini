name = "Repeated Regex";
description = "Repeated regex should be centralized. 

When a regex is repeatedly used in the code, it is getting harder to update. 

<?php

// Regex used several times, at least twice.
preg_match('/^abc_|^square$/i', $_GET['x']);

//.......

preg_match('/^abc_|^square$/i', $row['name']);

// This regex is dynamically built, so it is not reported.
preg_match('/^circle|^'.$x.'$/i', $string);

// This regex is used once, so it is not reported.
preg_match('/^circle|^square$/i', $string);

?>

Regex that are repeated at least once (aka, used twice or more) are reported. Regex that are dynamically build are not reported.
