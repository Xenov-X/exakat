name = "Don't Loop On Yield";
description = "Use ``yield from``, instead of looping on a generator with ``yield``.

``yield from`` delegate the yielding to another generator, and keep calling that generator until it is finished. It also works with implicit generator datastructure, like arrays.

<?php

function generator() {
    for($i = 0; $i < 10; ++$i) {
        yield $i;
    }
}

function delegatingGenerator() {
    yield from generator();
}

// Too much code here
function generator2() {
    foreach(generator() as $g) {
        yield $g;
    }
}

?>

There is a performance gain when delegating, over looping manually on the generator.
