name = "Mixed Concat And Interpolation";
description = "Mixed usage of concatenation and string interpolation is error prone. It is harder to read, and leads to overlooking the concatenation or the interpolation.

<?php

// Concatenation string
$a = $b . 'c' . $d;

// Interpolation strings
$a = "{$b}c{$d}";   // regular form
$a = "{$b}c$d";     // irregular form

// Mixed Concatenation and Interpolation string
$a = "{$b}c" . $d;
$a = $b . "c$d";
$a = $b . "c{$d}";

// Mixed Concatenation and Interpolation string with constant
$a = "{$b}c" . CONSTANT;

?>

Fixing this issue has no impact on the output. It makes code less error prone.

There are some situations where using concatenation are compulsory : when using a constant, calling a function, running a complex expression or make use of the escape sequence. You may also consider pushing the storing of such expression in a local variable.
