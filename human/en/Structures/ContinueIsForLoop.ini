name = "Continue Is For Loop";
description = "break and continue are very similar in PHP : they both break out of loop or switch. Yet, continue should be reserved for loops.

Since PHP 7.3, the execution will emit a warning when finding a continue inside a switch inside a loop : '\"continue\" targeting switch is equivalent to \"break\". Did you mean to use \"continue 2\"?'

<?php

while ($foo) {
    switch ($bar) {
        case 'baz':
            continue; // In PHP: Behaves like 'break;'
                      // In C:   Behaves like 'continue 2;'
    }
}

?>
