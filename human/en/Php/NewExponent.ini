name = "** For Exponent";
description = "PHP has the operator ** to provide exponents, instead of the slower function pow(). This operator was introduced in PHP 5.6.

<?php
    $cube = pow(2, 3); // 8

    $cubeInPHP56 = 2 ** 3; // 8
?>

If the code needs to be backward compatible to 5.5 or less, don't use the new operator.
