name = "Php 8.0 Only TypeHints";
description = "Two scalar typehints are introduced in version 8. They are ``false`` and ``null``. In PHP 7.0, both those values could not be used as a class or interface name, to avoid confusion with the actual booleans, nor ``null`` value.

``false`` represents a false boolean, and nothing else. It is more restrictive than a boolean, which accepts true too. 
``null`` is an alternative syntax to ``?`` : it allows the type to be ``null``. 

Both the above typehints are to be used in cunjunction with other types : they can't be used alone.

<?php

// function accepts an A object, or null. 
function foo(A|null $x) {}

// same as above
function foo2(A|null $x) {}

// returns an object of class B, or false
function bar($x) : false|B {}

?>
