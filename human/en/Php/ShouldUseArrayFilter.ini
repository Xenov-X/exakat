array_filter() is a native PHP function, that extract elements from an array, based on a closure. 

<?php

$a = range(0, 10); // integers from 0 to 10

$odds = array_filter(function($x) { return $x % 2; });

// Slow and cumbersome code
$odds = array();
foreach($a as $k => $v) {
    if ($a % 2 == 1) {
        $bColumn[] = $v;
    }
}

?>

array_column() is faster than foreach() (with or without the isset() test) with 3 elements or more, and it is significantly faster beyond 5 elements. Memory consumption is the same.
