name = "Should Preprocess Chr";
description = "Replace literal chr() calls with their escape sequence.

chr() is a functioncall, that cannot be cached. It is only resolved at execution time. 
On the other hand, literal values are pre-processed by PHP and may be cached.

<?php

// This is easier on PHP
$a = \"\120\110\120\040 is great!\";

// This is slow
$a = chr(80), chr(72), chr(80), chr(32), ' is great!';

// This would be the best with this example, but it is not always possible
$a = 'PHP is great!';

?>

This is a micro-optimisation.
