name = "Strange Name For Variables";
description = "Variables with strange names. They might be a typo, or simply bear strange patterns.

Any variable with three identical letter in a row are considered as strange. 2 letters in a row is classic, and while three letters may happen, it is rare enough. 

A list of classic typo is also used to find such variables.

This analysis is case-sensitive.

<?php

class foo {
    function bar() {
        // Strange name $tihs
        return $tihs;
    }
    
    function barbar() {
        // variables with blocks of 3 times the same character are reported
        // Based on Alexandre Joly's tweet
        $aaa = $bab + $www; 
    }
}

?>
