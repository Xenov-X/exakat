name = "Avoid Non Wordpress Globals";
description = "Refrain using any global variable that is not ``Wordpress``'s own. 

Global variables are available to write and read across the whole application, making their data both easily accessible, and difficult to track when an unexpected change happens. 
It is recommended to rely on a mix of arguments passing and class structures to reduce the code of any variable to a smaller part of the code.

<?php

my_hook() {
    // This is a Wordpress global
    $GLOBALS['is_safari'] = true;
    
    // is_iphone7 is not a Wordpress variable
    global $is_iphone7;
}

?>
