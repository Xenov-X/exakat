name = "Avoid Double Prepare";
description = "Double prepare shoud be avoided, for security reasons. 

When preparing in two phases, any placeholder from the first part may be escaped by the second prepare, leading to their neutralization. This way, injecting ' %s ', leads to creating %s outside quotes : ' ' %s ' ' (external quotes are from the first prepare, while the internal set of quotes are from the second).

It is recommended to build the query and to prepare it in one call, to avoid such pitfall.

<?php

// Only one prepare
    $args = [$u, $t];
    $res = $wpdb->prepare(' select * from table user = %s and type = %s', $args);

// also only one prepare
    $args = [$u];
    $query = 'select * from table user = %s and type = %s';
    if ( $condition) {
        $query .= ' and type = %s';
        $args[] = $t;
    }
    $res = $wpdb->prepare($query, $args);

// double prepare
    $where = $wpdb->prepare('where user = %s', $s); 
    $res = $wpdb->prepare(' select * from table $where AND other = %d', );

?>
