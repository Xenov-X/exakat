name = "Prepare Placeholder";
description = "$wpdb->prepare() only allows %d, %s and %F as placeholder. All others are not available. They are even enforced since Wordpress 4.8.3. 

In particular, absolute references are not allowed anymore, due to an injection vulnerability.

<?php

// valid place holders
  $query = $wpdb->prepare('SELECT * FROM table WHERE col = %s and col2 = %1$s and col3 = %F', 'string', 1, 1.2);

// valid place holders : invalid Wordpress placeholder
// This may be a valid vsprintf placeholder.
  $query = $wpdb->prepare('SELECT * FROM table WHERE col = %b', $integerDisplayedAsBinary);

// valid place holders : absolute reference. $var is used twice
  $query = $wpdb->prepare('SELECT * FROM table WHERE col = %s and %1$s', $var);

?>
