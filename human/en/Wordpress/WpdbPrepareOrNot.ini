name = "Wpdb Prepare Or Not";
description = "Always use $wpdb->prepare() when variables are used in the SQL query.

When using $wpdb, it is recommended to use directly the query() method when the SQL is not using variables.

<?php

// No need to prepare this query : it is all known at coding time.
$wpdb->prepare('INSERT INTO table VALUES (1,2,3)');

// No need to prepare this query : $wpdb->prefix is safe
$wpdb->prepare('INSERT INTO {$wpdb->prefix}table values (1,2,3)');

// Don't use query when variable are involved : always use prepare
$wpdb->query('INSERT INTO TABLE values (1,2,'.$var.')');

?>
