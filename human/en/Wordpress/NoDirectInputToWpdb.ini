description = "Avoid using incoming variables when building SQL queries with $wpdb->prepare().

(This is quoted directly from Anthony Ferrera blog, link below).
In general however, go through and remove all user input from the $query side of ->prepare(). NEVER pass user input to the query side. Meaning, never do this (in any form):

<?php
  $where = $wpdb->prepare(' WHERE foo = %s', $_GET['data']);
  $query = $wpdb->prepare('SELECT * FROM something $where LIMIT %d, %d', 1, 2);
?>

This is known as 'double-preparing' and is not a good design.
(End of quote).
