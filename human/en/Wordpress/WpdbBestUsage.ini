description = "Use the adapted API with $wpdb.

Wordpress database API ($wpdb) offers several eponymous methods to safely handle insert, delete, replace and update. 

It is recommended to use them, instead of writing queries with concatenations.

<?php
// Example from Wordpress Manual
$user_count = $wpdb->get_var( \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM $wpdb->users\" );
echo <p>User count is {$user_count}</p>;
?>

See `Class Reference/wpdb <https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/wpdb>`_
