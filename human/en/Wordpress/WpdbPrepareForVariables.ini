name = "Use Prepare With Variables";
description = "Avoid building SQL queries with concatenation.

Anytime variables are used in SQL queries, it is recommended to use the prepare() method, instead of directly get_results() and co.

This applies to the following methods : get_var(), get_results(), get_row(), get_col().

This also applies to double-quoted strings, heredoc syntax, concatenations and any mix of the previous.

<?php

// Best way to handle variables : 
$wpdb->get_results($wpdb->prepare('SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = %s', $x1));

// Same as above, but with security concern on $x1
// Don't concatenate variables to build Query
$wpdb->get_results('SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = "'.$x1.'"');

// get_col + double-quote
$wpdb->get_col(\"SELECT id FROM table WHERE id = '$x2'\");

// get_row + heredoc
$wpdb->get_row(<<<SQL
SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = '$x3'
SQL
);

?>

Note that usage of $wpdb properties in the SQL queries is not reported by this analyser.
