name = "Mismatched Default Arguments";
description = "Arguments are relayed from one method to the other, and the arguments have different default values. 

Although it is possible to have different default values, it is worth checking why this is actually the case.

<?php

function foo($a = null, $b = array() ) {
    // foo method calls directly bar. 
    // When argument are provided, it's OK
    // When argument are omited, the default value is not the same as the next method
    bar($a, $b);
}

function bar($c = 1, $d = array() ) {
